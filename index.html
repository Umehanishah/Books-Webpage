        <p>“I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!
             How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book! 
             — When I have a house of my own, I shall 
            be miserable if I have not an excellent library.” 
            ― Jane Austen</p>
            
        <p>“Reading is escape, and the opposite of escape; it's a way 
        to make contact with reality after a day of making things 
        up, and it's a way of making contact with someone else's 
        imagination after a day that's all too real.” ― Nora Ephron

                    Trouble was, the androids all looked exactly like humans, and they didn't want to be found!</p>
